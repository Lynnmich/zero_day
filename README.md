Vagrant is an open-source tool that helps in creating and managing virtual development environments. It simplifies the process of setting up and configuring virtual machines (VMs) for development purposes. Vagrant provides a consistent and reproducible environment across different platforms, allowing developers to work in a controlled and isolated environment.

Vagrant simplifies the process of setting up and managing development environments by providing a consistent and reproducible infrastructure. It allows developers to focus on writing code rather than dealing with complex VM configurations. With Vagrant, developers can easily share their development environments with team members, ensuring consistent setups across different machines.
